# Selenium 4 Java Automation Project

## About

For this project, I used the Java programming language and the TestNG testing framework to write automated tests in Selenium 4. The framework is designed to support a wide range of web-based applications. The project is divided into two distinct components:

- **Infrastructure**: This part includes design patterns, libraries, common operations, and external tools that support the execution of the tests.
- **Testing**: This part focuses on writing and executing tests.

## Key Project Features

- Emulating Network Conditions: Utilized Selenium 4 to simulate diverse network types and conditions.
- Screenshot Capture: Integrated screenshot capture of elements and pages for comprehensive visual validation.
- Tab and Window Handling: Simulated user interactions across multiple browser tabs/windows.
- Modular Structure: Divided into the Infrastructure and Testing components for a scalable framework.
- Page Object Design Pattern: Enhances code maintainability and readability by efficiently interacting with web elements.
- Project Layers: Organized into extensions, workflows, and test cases for better scalability.
- Failure Handling: Utilizes event listeners for graceful test failure management.
- External Files Support (Data-Driven Testing): Supports loading testing data from CSV files for dynamic testing approaches.
- Reporting System: Integrates Allure Reports with screenshots for detailed test result insights.
- Visual Testing Capabilities: Employed Sikuli to detect UI discrepancies and ensure visual integrity in applications.
- Retry Mechanism: Adds retry logic for failed tests. The retry mechanism is implemented by using a `RetryAnalyzer` class to automatically re-run failed tests a specified number of times.
